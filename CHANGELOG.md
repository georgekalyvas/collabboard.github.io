# CollabBoard Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-31

### ðŸŽ‰ Fixed - Cross-Browser Share Links

**Problem**: Share links only worked on the creator's browser because meeting data was stored in localStorage, which is browser-specific.

**Solution**: Implemented URL-based data sharing where all meeting data is encoded and embedded in the shareable link.

### Changes Made

#### Core Functionality

1. **Added `updateUrlWithBoardData(boardData)`**
   - Encodes board data as Base64
   - Embeds in URL hash (`#data=...`)
   - Updates URL without page reload

2. **Added `loadBoardFromUrl()`**
   - Extracts and decodes board data from URL hash
   - Automatically saves to localStorage for persistence
   - Enables cross-browser data sharing

3. **Added `getShareableUrl()`**
   - Generates complete URL with embedded data
   - Used by share modal, QR codes, and social sharing
   - Ensures all participants get the same data

4. **Modified `checkUrlForBoard()`**
   - Now prioritizes URL hash data over localStorage
   - Falls back to localStorage for creator's browser
   - Enables seamless cross-browser loading

5. **Modified `syncBoard()`**
   - Checks URL for updates first
   - Enables pseudo-real-time collaboration via URL updates

6. **Modified `createBoard()`**
   - Generates shareable URL immediately on creation
   - Updates browser URL with embedded data

7. **Modified Share Functions**
   - `shareViaEmail()`: Now includes full data URL
   - `shareViaTeams()`: Now includes full data URL
   - `shareViaSlack()`: Now includes full data URL
   - All share methods now explicitly mention cross-browser compatibility

### Benefits

âœ… **No Backend Required**: Works without any server or database  
âœ… **True Cross-Browser**: Share links work on any browser, any device  
âœ… **Instant Sharing**: No registration or authentication needed  
âœ… **Offline Capable**: Works offline after initial load  
âœ… **QR Code Friendly**: Mobile devices can scan and join immediately  
âœ… **URL-Based State**: All meeting state travels with the link  

### Technical Notes

- URLs contain Base64-encoded JSON data in hash fragment
- Backward compatible with localStorage for persistence
- Supports URL lengths up to browser limits (typically 2MB+)
- Data is visible in URL (not encrypted by default)

### Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing guide including:
- Cross-browser testing scenarios
- QR code testing
- Social sharing verification
- Troubleshooting tips

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Add LZ-String compression for shorter URLs
- [ ] Optional encryption with user-defined passphrase
- [ ] Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- [ ] Version history and rollback
- [ ] Export/import functionality

### Breaking Changes

None - This is backward compatible with existing functionality.

## How to Update

Simply replace your `app.js` file with the new version. No other changes required.

The app will automatically:
1. Load data from URLs when available
2. Fall back to localStorage for backward compatibility
3. Generate shareable URLs with embedded data for all new and existing meetings

## Migration Notes

If you have existing meetings in localStorage:
1. Open the meeting in your browser
2. Click "ðŸ“¤ Share" to generate a new URL with embedded data
3. Share this new URL with participants
4. Old localStorage data remains for your browser, but new URL enables cross-browser access
