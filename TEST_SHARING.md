# Testing the Share Link Fix

## Quick Test Steps

### Test 1: Cross-Browser Sharing
1. Open the app in **Browser A** (e.g., Chrome)
2. Create a new board meeting:
   - Your Name: "Test Creator"
   - Meeting Title: "Test Meeting"
   - Click "Create Board Meeting"
3. Add at least one agenda item
4. Click the **"üì§ Share"** button
5. Copy the share link (you should see: "‚úì This link works across all browsers and devices")
6. Open the link in **Browser B** (e.g., Firefox or an Incognito window)
7. ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: You should see the "Join Board Meeting" page with "Test Meeting" displayed

### Test 2: QR Code Sharing
1. Follow steps 1-5 from Test 1
2. Scan the QR code with your mobile device
3. ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: Your mobile browser opens the join page with the correct meeting

### Test 3: Multiple Participants
1. Create a board in Browser A
2. Share the link and open it in Browser B
3. Join as "Participant 1" in Browser B
4. Open the same link in Browser C (or another incognito window)
5. Join as "Participant 2" in Browser C
6. ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: All participants can see the meeting, though changes won't sync in real-time

### Test 4: URL Encoding
1. Create a board with special characters in the title: "Q&A Session - 2025 #1"
2. Add items with various types (voting, non-voting)
3. Share the link
4. ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: The URL should be properly encoded and work when opened

## What to Look For

### Success Indicators ‚úÖ
- [ ] Share link opens in different browsers
- [ ] QR code works when scanned
- [ ] Meeting title displays correctly
- [ ] Agenda items are visible
- [ ] Participants list shows correctly
- [ ] No console errors about "Board not found"

### Known Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Changes made in one browser won't automatically appear in other browsers (no real-time sync)
- Very large boards may create long URLs (but should still work)
- Each participant works with their own copy of the board data

## Debugging

If something doesn't work, check the browser console for:
```javascript
// Should see these logs:
"Checking URL for board: board_xxxxx"
"Has encoded data: true"
"Board data decoded from URL"
"Board found, showing join page"
```

If you see:
```javascript
"Board not found"
```
This means the URL encoding/decoding failed. Check if:
1. The URL is complete (not truncated)
2. The `data` parameter is present in the URL
3. There are no console errors about encoding/decoding

## Example Working URL Structure

```
https://yoursite.com/?board=board_abc123&data=eyJ0aXRsZSI6IlRlc3QgTWVldGluZyIsImNyZWF0b3IiOiJUZXN0...
                                            ‚Üë                  ‚Üë
                                       Board ID          Encoded board data (Base64)
```

The `data` parameter should be a long string of alphanumeric characters (Base64 encoded).
